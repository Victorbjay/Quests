## 🎯 What Are Combinations?

Imagine you have a toy box with numbered blocks: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

**Combinations** mean picking some blocks in a special order where:
- ✅ Each block can only be used once
- ✅ Smaller numbers come before bigger numbers
- ✅ No repeating the same block

### Real-Life Example:
Think of choosing 3 friends to sit in a row:
- If you pick Amy, Bob, and Charlie
- They must sit in alphabetical order: Amy, Bob, Charlie
- You can't pick Amy twice
- Bob can't sit before Amy

That's a combination!

## 🔢 Starting Simple: PrintDigits

### The Problem:
Print all digits from 0 to 9.

### Think Like This:
```
I have 10 blocks numbered 0-9.
I need to show each one, one at a time.
```

### The Solution (Step by Step):
```go
func PrintDigits() {
    // Start with block 0
    for digit := '0'; digit <= '9'; digit++ {
        // Show this block
        z01.PrintRune(digit)
    }
    // Go to next line
    z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

### Visualization:
```
📦0 → Print "0"
📦1 → Print "1"
📦2 → Print "2"
...
📦9 → Print "9"
Result: 0123456789
```

### 🧠 Key Concept: **LOOP**
A loop is like walking through your toy blocks one by one.

---

## 🎲 Moving Up: PrintComb (3 digits)

### The Problem:
Print all combinations of 3 **different** digits where first < second < third.

Examples: 012, 013, 014, ... 789

### Think Like This:
```
I need to pick 3 blocks.
First block: Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 (not 8 or 9, because I need 2 more blocks after it)
Second block: Must be bigger than first
Third block: Must be bigger than second
```

### The Solution (Step by Step):
```go
func PrintComb() {
    // Pick first block (0 to 7)
    for i := '0'; i <= '7'; i++ {
        // Pick second block (must be bigger than first)
        for j := i + 1; j <= '8'; j++ {
            // Pick third block (must be bigger than second)
            for k := j + 1; k <= '9'; k++ {
                // Show the three blocks
                z01.PrintRune(i)
                z01.PrintRune(j)
                z01.PrintRune(k)
                
                // Add comma unless it's the last one (789)
                if i != '7' || j != '8' || k != '9' {
                    z01.PrintRune(',')
                    z01.PrintRune(' ')
                }
            }
        }
    }
    z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

### Visualization:
```
First block: 0
  Second block: 1
    Third block: 2 → Print "012, "
    Third block: 3 → Print "013, "
    ...
  Second block: 2
    Third block: 3 → Print "023, "
    ...
First block: 7
  Second block: 8
    Third block: 9 → Print "789" (no comma, it's the last!)
```

### 🧠 Key Concept: **NESTED LOOPS**
It's like having boxes inside boxes:
- Big box (first digit)
  - Medium box (second digit)
    - Small box (third digit)

---

## 🎯 Getting Harder: PrintComb2 (2 two-digit numbers)

### The Problem:
Print pairs of 2-digit numbers where first < second.

Examples: 00 01, 00 02, ... 98 99

### Think Like This:
```
Instead of single blocks, I now have double blocks:
00, 01, 02, 03, ... 97, 98, 99

I need to pick 2 double blocks where first < second.
```

### Breaking Down a Number:
```
Number 42:
- Tens digit: 4 (the first digit)
- Units digit: 2 (the second digit)

To get them:
42 / 10 = 4 (tens digit)
42 % 10 = 2 (units digit, remainder)
```

### The Solution (Step by Step):
```go
func PrintComb2() {
    // Pick first number (0 to 98)
    for i := 0; i <= 98; i++ {
        // Pick second number (must be bigger than first)
        for j := i + 1; j <= 99; j++ {
            // Print first number (2 digits)
            z01.PrintRune(rune('0' + i/10))  // tens digit
            z01.PrintRune(rune('0' + i%10))  // units digit
            
            z01.PrintRune(' ')  // space between numbers
            
            // Print second number (2 digits)
            z01.PrintRune(rune('0' + j/10))  // tens digit
            z01.PrintRune(rune('0' + j%10))  // units digit
            
            // Add comma unless it's the last one (98 99)
            if i != 98 || j != 99 {
                z01.PrintRune(',')
                z01.PrintRune(' ')
            }
        }
    }
    z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

### Visualization:
```
i = 0 (00)
  j = 1 (01) → Print "00 01, "
  j = 2 (02) → Print "00 02, "
  ...
  j = 99 (99) → Print "00 99, "
  
i = 1 (01)
  j = 2 (02) → Print "01 02, "
  ...

i = 98 (98)
  j = 99 (99) → Print "98 99" (last one!)
```

### 🧠 Key Concepts: 
- **Division (/)**: Splits a number into parts
- **Modulo (%)**: Gets the remainder (the leftover)

## 🚀 The Ultimate Challenge: PrintCombN

### The Problem:
Print all combinations of **n** different digits (n can be 1, 2, 3, ... 9).

This is like the previous problems, but now you don't know how many blocks to pick!

### Think Like This:
```
Instead of knowing "I need 3 blocks" or "I need 2 pairs",
now someone tells me: "Pick n blocks" and n can change!

If n = 1: Just print 0, 1, 2, ... 9
If n = 3: Print 012, 013, ... 789
If n = 9: Print 012345678, 012345679, 123456789
```

### The Big Idea: RECURSION

**Recursion** is like a Russian doll 🪆 - dolls inside dolls inside dolls!

Imagine building a tower:
1. Place first block
2. Place second block on top (but it must be bigger than first)
3. Place third block on top (but it must be bigger than second)
4. Keep going until tower is n blocks tall

### The Solution Explained:

#### Part 1: Setup
```go
func PrintCombN(n int) {
    // Make a list to hold our blocks
    comb := make([]int, n)
    
    // Start building from position 0
    printCombinations(comb, n, 0)
    
    // Print newline at end
    z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

#### Part 2: Building the Tower (Recursion)
```go
func printCombinations(comb []int, n int, pos int) {
    // Are we done building? (Tower is n blocks tall)
    if pos == n {
        printComb(comb, n)  // Show the tower!
        return
    }
    
    // What's the smallest block we can use here?
    start := 0
    if pos > 0 {
        start = comb[pos-1] + 1  // Must be bigger than previous block
    }
    
    // Try every possible block from start to 9
    // But make sure we have enough blocks left!
    for digit := start; digit <= 9-(n-pos-1); digit++ {
        comb[pos] = digit  // Place this block
        printCombinations(comb, n, pos+1)  // Build next level
    }
}
```

#### Part 3: Showing the Tower
```go
func printComb(comb []int, n int) {
    // Print all the blocks in the tower
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        z01.PrintRune(rune('0' + comb[i]))
    }
    
    // Is this the last possible tower?
    isLast := true
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if comb[i] != 10-n+i {
            isLast = false
            break
        }
    }
    
    // Add comma and space if not last
    if !isLast {
        z01.PrintRune(',')
        z01.PrintRune(' ')
    }
}
```

### 🎨 Visual Example (n = 3):

```
Position 0: Try block 0
  Position 1: Try block 1
    Position 2: Try block 2 → Tower: 0,1,2 → Print "012, "
    Position 2: Try block 3 → Tower: 0,1,3 → Print "013, "
    Position 2: Try block 4 → Tower: 0,1,4 → Print "014, "
    ...
  Position 1: Try block 2
    Position 2: Try block 3 → Tower: 0,2,3 → Print "023, "
    ...
Position 0: Try block 7
  Position 1: Try block 8
    Position 2: Try block 9 → Tower: 7,8,9 → Print "789"
```

### 🧠 Key Concepts:

#### 1. **Recursion = Function Calling Itself**
```
Building tower for n=3:
  Build position 0
    Build position 1
      Build position 2
        Done! Print it.
```

#### 2. **The Magic Formula: `digit <= 9-(n-pos-1)`**

Let's understand this with n=3:

```
Position 0 (pos=0):
  digit <= 9-(3-0-1) = 9-2 = 7
  Why? Because after 7, we need 2 more digits (8 and 9)
  
Position 1 (pos=1):
  digit <= 9-(3-1-1) = 9-1 = 8
  Why? Because after 8, we need 1 more digit (9)
  
Position 2 (pos=2):
  digit <= 9-(3-2-1) = 9-0 = 9
  Why? Because this is the last position
```

#### 3. **Checking if Last Combination**

For n=3, last combination is 789:
```
Position 0: 7 (which is 10-3+0 = 7) ✓
Position 1: 8 (which is 10-3+1 = 8) ✓
Position 2: 9 (which is 10-3+2 = 9) ✓
```

## 🎯 Problem-Solving Strategy

### Step 1: Understand the Pattern
Draw it out with examples!

```
For n=1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
For n=2: 01, 02, 03, ..., 89
For n=3: 012, 013, 014, ..., 789
```

**Pattern:** Each digit must be bigger than the previous one!

### Step 2: Start Small
Can you solve it for a fixed number first?
- Solve for n=1 (easy!)
- Solve for n=3 (medium)
- Then solve for any n (hard!)

### Step 3: Break It Down
```
Big Problem: Print all combinations
  ↓
Smaller Problem: Print one combination
  ↓
Tiny Problem: Print one digit
```

### Step 4: Use Loops or Recursion

**When to use loops:**
- You know exactly how many times to repeat
- Simple, fixed pattern
- Example: PrintComb (always 3 digits)

**When to use recursion:**
- You don't know how many times to repeat
- Pattern depends on input
- Example: PrintCombN (n can change)

## 🎓 Understanding Recursion (The Russian Doll Way)

### The Story:
Imagine you have a job: "Count all dolls in Russian dolls"

```
Open big doll
  Inside: medium doll
    Open medium doll
      Inside: small doll
        Open small doll
          Inside: nothing
          Return 1 (one doll)
        Return 1 + 1 = 2 (two dolls)
      Return 2 + 1 = 3 (three dolls)
    Return 3 (three dolls total)
```

### In Code Terms:
```go
func countDolls(doll) {
    // Base case: No more dolls inside
    if doll is empty {
        return 0
    }
    
    // Recursive case: Count this doll + dolls inside
    return 1 + countDolls(doll.inside)
}
```

### For PrintCombN:
```go
func buildTower(blocks, height, currentLevel) {
    // Base case: Tower is tall enough
    if currentLevel == height {
        print tower
        return
    }
    
    // Recursive case: Add one block, then build higher
    for each possible block {
        place block at currentLevel
        buildTower(blocks, height, currentLevel+1)
    }
}
```

---

## 🧮 Common Patterns in These Problems

### Pattern 1: Nested Loops for Fixed Combinations
```go
for first := start1; first <= end1; first++ {
    for second := first+1; second <= end2; second++ {
        for third := second+1; third <= end3; third++ {
            // Do something
        }
    }
}
```

**When to use:** You know exactly how many levels deep

### Pattern 2: Recursion for Variable Combinations
```go
func combine(position) {
    if position == max {
        print result
        return
    }
    for digit := minForThisPosition; digit <= maxForThisPosition; digit++ {
        select digit
        combine(position + 1)
    }
}
```

**When to use:** The depth changes based on input

### Pattern 3: Converting Numbers to Digits
```go
// Get individual digits from a number
tens := number / 10
units := number % 10

// Convert digit to character
character := '0' + digit
```

### Pattern 4: Checking if Last
```go
// For sequences, check if at maximum value
isLast := true
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
    if current[i] != maximum[i] {
        isLast = false
        break
    }
}
```

## 📝 Practice Exercises (From Easy to Hard)

### 🟢 Level 1: Print Alphabet
Print all letters from 'a' to 'z'
```
Expected: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

**Hint:** Just like PrintDigits, but with letters!

### 🟡 Level 2: Print Pairs
Print all pairs of different digits where first < second
```
Expected: 01, 02, 03, ..., 89
```

**Hint:** Two nested loops!

### 🟠 Level 3: Print Triples (Reverse)
Print all combinations of 3 digits in descending order
```
Expected: 987, 986, 985, ..., 210
```

**Hint:** Start from 9, work backwards!

### 🔴 Level 4: Print Specific Length
Write a function that prints all combinations of exactly 4 different digits
```
Expected: 0123, 0124, 0125, ..., 6789
```

**Hint:** Four nested loops!

### 🔴🔴 Level 5: Print Any Length (Like PrintCombN)
Now make it work for any n!

---

## 🎯 Tips for Success

### 1. **Draw It Out**
Before coding, draw the pattern on paper:
```
n=2:
0 1
0 2
0 3
...
```

### 2. **Start with Examples**
Write out what the first 5 and last 5 outputs should be:
```
First 5: 012, 013, 014, 015, 016
Last 5: 589, 678, 679, 689, 789
```

### 3. **Test Edge Cases**
What happens when:
- n = 1? (only one digit)
- n = 9? (almost all digits)
- n = 10? (impossible! Should handle gracefully)

### 4. **Debug with Print Statements**
Add prints to see what's happening:
```go
fmt.Println("Trying digit", digit, "at position", pos)
```

### 5. **Build Incrementally**
Don't write everything at once:
1. First, make it print something (anything!)
2. Then, make it print the right things
3. Finally, make it efficient

---

## 🌟 The Big Takeaway

**Programming is about breaking big problems into small pieces!**

```
Big Problem: PrintCombN
  ↓
Medium Problem: Try each starting digit
  ↓
Small Problem: For each start, try next digit
  ↓
Tiny Problem: Print one digit
```

**Recursion is just:**
1. Do a little bit
2. Ask someone else to do the rest (yourself, later!)
3. Trust that it will work

**Loops are just:**
1. Do something
2. Do it again
3. Keep going until done

---

## 🎓 Quiz Time!

### Question 1:
Why does PrintComb start from '0' and go to '7' (not '9')?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

Because we need 2 more digits after the first one! If we started with 8, we'd only have 9 left for the other two positions.
</details>

### Question 2:
In PrintComb2, what does `i/10` do to the number 42?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

It gives us 4 (the tens digit). Division by 10 removes the last digit.
</details>

### Question 3:
In PrintCombN, why do we use `digit <= 9-(n-pos-1)`?

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

To make sure we leave enough digits for the remaining positions. If we're at position 0 and need 3 total digits, we can't use 8 or 9 because we need 2 more digits after.
</details>

Perfect ❤️ — let’s go again slowly, step by step, how to code in Go 👶💻

We’ll take the another three exercises we already solved — and I’ll explain **why** and **how** each line works, using simple stories and examples.
By the end, you’ll *never forget how to think like Go*.

---

## 🅰️ 1. **printalphabet**

### 🧠 What they asked

> “Write a program that prints all lowercase letters from **a** to **z** on one line.”

That’s it! Just like singing your alphabet song.

### 🧩 How we think about it

In programming, letters (like `a` or `z`) are not magic — each one has a **number behind it** (in ASCII).
So `'a'` is actually number **97**, `'b'` is **98**, and so on, up to `'z'` which is **122**.

If we start at `'a'` and keep adding 1 each time, we’ll reach `'z'`.

---

### ✅ Solution

```go
package main

import "github.com/01-edu/z01"

func main() {
	for c := 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++ {
		z01.PrintRune(c)
	}
	z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

### 🧒 Explanation (like storytime)

* `for c := 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++`
  means: “start with the letter **a**, stop when you reach **z**, and move one letter forward each time.”
* `z01.PrintRune(c)`
  prints that letter on the screen.
* `z01.PrintRune('\n')`
  prints a “new line” — like pressing Enter.

---

## 🔁 2. **printreversealphabet**

### 🧠 What they asked

> “Print the alphabet backwards — from z to a.”

We can use the same trick, just count *backwards*.

---

### ✅ Solution

```go
package main

import "github.com/01-edu/z01"

func main() {
	for c := 'z'; c >= 'a'; c-- {
		z01.PrintRune(c)
	}
	z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

### 🧒 Explanation

* We start at `'z'`.
* Each time we **subtract one** (`c--`) — Go moves one letter backward.
* When we reach `'a'`, the loop stops.
* It prints all letters in reverse order — no magic, just counting down the alphabet numbers!

---

## 🔢 3. **printcomb2**

### 🧠 What they asked

> “Print all combinations of two *different* two-digit numbers — from 00 to 99.”

So we start from **00 01**, then **00 02**, all the way until **98 99**.
It’s like listing all pairs of numbers on a scoreboard.

---

### 🧩 Step-by-step logic

1. The **first number** (`i`) goes from 0 → 98.
2. The **second number** (`j`) always starts just after `i` (so they’re different).

   * If `i` is 0, `j` starts from 1.
   * If `i` is 5, `j` starts from 6.
   * and so on.
3. We print `i` and `j` like `00 01, 00 02, 00 03…`
4. When we reach `98 99`, we stop.

---

### ✅ Solution

```go
package piscine

import "github.com/01-edu/z01"

func PrintComb2() {
	var i rune
	var j rune
	for i = 0; i <= 98; i++ {
		for j = i + 1; j <= 99; j++ {
			z01.PrintRune('0' + i/10) // first digit of i
			z01.PrintRune('0' + i%10) // second digit of i
			z01.PrintRune(' ')
			z01.PrintRune('0' + j/10) // first digit of j
			z01.PrintRune('0' + j%10) // second digit of j
			if i != 98 || j != 99 {
				z01.PrintRune(',')
				z01.PrintRune(' ')
			}
		}
	}
	z01.PrintRune('\n')
}
```

---

### 🧒 Explanation (like counting candy bags 🍬)

Let’s say we number candy bags from `00` to `99`.

* The **first bag** (`i`) is `00`
* The **next bag** (`j`) is `01`
* Print them together: `00 01`
* Then move `j` up one: `00 02`, `00 03`…
* When we run out of `j` (99), we move `i` up to 01 and start again:
  → `01 02`, `01 03`, etc.

The trickiest part is printing numbers like `05` or `09` —
we get them using:

* `'0' + i/10` → tens digit (0)
* `'0' + i%10` → ones digit (5)

Together, that prints `05` without any casting!

Happy coding! 💻✨
