## What Is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is what you ask an AI. It's how you communicate with language models like GPT, Claude, or Grok.

---

## Types of Prompts

### 1. Direct Instruction
**"Do this task."**

Example: "List three programming languages"
- Best for: Getting structured outputs (lists, steps)

---

### 2. Question
**"Answer this."**

Example: "What are the benefits of Python?"
- Best for: Learning explanations, deeper understanding

---

### 3. Refined Prompt
**"Do this, with these specifics."**

Example: "Explain AI to a complete beginner in simple terms"
- Best for: Getting exactly what you need

## Anatomy of a Prompt

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Task | "Explain..." |
| Audience | "...to a beginner" |
| Format | "...in bullet points" |
| Scope | "...focusing on healthcare" |

---

## Parameters Explained

### Temperature

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Focused, deterministic, same answers |
| 0.4 - 0.7 | Balanced |
| 0.8 - 1.0 | Creative, diverse, unpredictable |

**When to use:**
- Low temp: Code, facts, summaries
- High temp: Creative writing, brainstorming

### Top-p
Controls nucleus sampling — limits word choices to most likely candidates. Similar effect to temperature but different mechanism.

## Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot

### Zero-Shot
Just give the task — no examples.

> "Translate this to French: Hello"

### Few-Shot
Give examples first.

> "Translate to French:
> Hello - Bonjour
> Goodbye - Au revoir
> Thank you - ?"

**Few-shot works better for complex tasks.**

---

## Quick Reference

| Goal | Prompt Tip |
|------|------------|
| Get a list | Use direct instructions |
| Learn something | Ask questions |
| Be specific | Add context, audience, format |
| Get creative | Use higher temperature |
| Get facts | Use lower temperature |
| Complex task | Use few-shot examples |

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Be specific** — The more detail, the better
2. **Define audience** — "Explain like I'm 5" works!
3. **Choose format** — "In 3 bullet points" or "as a poem"
4. **Iterate** — If first try isn't good, refine and retry
