## What Are Role Prompts?

A **role prompt** tells the AI to respond as a specific type of person or professional.

Example:
> "Act as a scientist..." 
> "You are a coding mentor..."
> "Write this as a journalist..."

## Tone vs. Role

| What | Controls |
|------|----------|
| **Role** | WHO the AI is — perspective, expertise |
| **Tone** | HOW it speaks — friendly, formal, etc. |

You can combine both:
> "Act as a friendly recruiter and write a warm, professional email..."

## Examples

### Example 1: Same Question, Different Roles

**Question:** "What is Python?"

| Role | Response |
|------|----------|
| Scientist | Technical explanation with data |
| Journalist | Simple, public-friendly version |
| Critic | Points out limitations/concerns |

---

### Example 2: Same Task, Different Tones

**Task:** Write an email

| Tone | Result |
|------|--------|
| Friendly | "Hey! Hope you're doing well..." |
| Professional | "Dear Mr./Ms.... Kind regards..." |
| Casual | "Quick email to let you know..." |

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Be specific about the role** — "coding mentor" is better than "helper"
2. **Combine with context** — Add what you want, not just who
3. **Specify tone** — Friendly, professional, casual
4. **Iterate** — If not right, refine the role description
