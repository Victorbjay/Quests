## What Is Chain-of-Thought?

**Chain-of-thought (CoT)** = asking AI to "think out loud" and show its reasoning steps before giving the final answer.

---

## Why Use It?

| Without CoT | With CoT |
|-------------|----------|
| Just gives answer | Shows how it got there |
| Hard to verify | Clear logic path |
| Can't find mistakes | Easier to debug |
| Feels like magic | Transparent |

---

## How to Trigger Chain-of-Thought

### Simple Phrases

> "Let's think step by step."

> "Explain your reasoning before answering."

> "Walk me through your thinking."

> "First, then, finally..."

---

## Types of Reasoning Prompts

### 1. Direct CoT
> "Solve this: 5 + 3 × 2. Let's think step by step."

### 2. Logic Puzzles
> "Alice is taller than Bob. Bob is taller than Carol. Who is shortest? Show your reasoning."

### 3. Multi-Step
> "What is 20% of 150? First find the sum, then calculate the percentage."

### 4. Math Problems
> "Calculate 5! Show each step."

## Examples

### Math Example

**Without:** "What's 25% of 80?" → "20"

**With:** "What's 25% of 80? Think step by step."

→ "First, 25% = 25/100 = 0.25"
→ "Then, 80 × 0.25 = 20"
→ "Answer: 20"

---

### Logic Example

**Without:** "Who is youngest?" → "Carol"

**With:** "Explain your reasoning..."
→ "Alice > Bob > Carol"
→ "Carol is youngest"

## When to Use CoT

| Use For | Don't Use For |
|---------|--------------|
| Math problems | Simple facts |
| Logic puzzles | Quick questions |
| Complex calculations | Either/or choices |
| Debugging AI thinking | Creative writing |
| Learning/education | When you just want answer |

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Be explicit** — "Show your reasoning" or "Think step by step"
2. **Break complex problems** — Ask for steps explicitly
3. **Verify the logic** — Check each intermediate step
4. **Combine with roles** — "As a mathematician, explain..."

## Quick Reference

| Phrase | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| "Let's think step by step" | Detailed reasoning |
| "Explain your reasoning" | Educational output |
| "First... then... finally" | Structured multi-step |
| "Walk me through this" | Narrative explanation |
