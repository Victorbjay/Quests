> A beginner-friendly guide to understanding AI ethics, bias, and responsible AI use.

## What Is This?

This guide accompanies the **01-Edu AI Ethics exercise**. It breaks down the key concepts in simple terms so anyone can understand.

## Module 1: AI as a Tool — Not a Replacement

### The Core Idea

AI is like a power tool. Used wisely, it makes you faster. Used poorly, it makes you dependent.

| ✅ Right Way | ❌ Wrong Way |
|-------------|--------------|
| Use AI after you've tried | Ask AI before you try |
| Ask "why does this work?" | Copy-paste without understanding |
| Use AI to deepen knowledge | Use AI to avoid learning |
| Verify AI's answers | Trust everything AI says |

### Analogy

Think of AI like a calculator:
- Using a calculator AFTER you understand math → powerful
- Using a calculator BEFORE you learn math → you never learn

---

## Module 2: Understanding AI Bias

### What Is Bias?

Bias means AI has unfair preferences — like assuming all doctors are men, or that "Tinubu" always means the president.

### Why Bias Exists

AI learns from data. If the data has bias, AI will too!

**Example:**
- If training data has mostly male doctors → AI thinks doctors are male
- If AI trains on AI-generated content → "copy of a copy" problem

### How to Spot Bias

Ask yourself:
- Does this assume something about gender, race, or profession?
- Is the question too vague?
- Am I asking for facts or opinions?

## Module 3: Writing Ethical Prompts

### The Problem with Bad Prompts

| Bad Prompt | Why It's Bad | Better Prompt |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| "Tinubu is bad" | Assumes political figure | "My uncle Tinubu..." |
| "What's the best way?" | Too vague | "Best way to bake a cake?" |
| "The doctor is great, right?" | Leading, assumes gender | "Dr. Smith's strengths?" |

### The Rules

1. **Be specific** — Don't make AI guess
2. **Remove assumptions** — Don't assume gender, race, profession
3. **Ask balanced questions** — Don't lead AI to agree
4. **Add context** — Help AI understand what you mean

## Module 4: Detecting Harmful Outputs

### When NOT to Trust AI

⚠️ **Never get AI to do this:**
- Medical advice (always see a real doctor)
- Legal advice (always see a real lawyer)
- Financial decisions (always consult a professional)

### Red Flags

- AI sounds too confident
- No sources or references
- Medical/legal/financial "advice"
- No disclaimer

### The Human Safety Net

> "If you rely on AI to detect AI's problems, you're in trouble."

Always verify. Always think. AI can help, but humans must stay in control.

## Module 5: The Learning Amplifier Method

### The Right Way to Learn

```
1. STRUGGLE first (20-30 min minimum)
2. Solve it yourself (even if messy)
3. THEN ask AI to validate/expand
4. Reflect on what you learned
```

### Why This Works

- You build mental models
- You can explain it later
- You remember it longer
- You're irreplaceable

---

### Exercise 4: Apply the Method

**Topic:** Wireless Routing Protocols

**Phase 1: Build Foundation (You First)**
- Study the topic yourself first
- Self-explain in your own words
- Design a simple scenario (5-10 devices) with justification

Example: Home network with laptop (5GHz), phone (2.4GHz), smart TV, smart bulb, printer

**Phase 2: Strategic AI Use**
After attempting yourself, ask AI to:
- Validate your understanding
- Explore edge cases
- Challenge your assumptions

**Phase 3: Real Application**
Design a complex scenario:
- 1,000 IoT sensors → LoRaWAN/Zigbee (low power, long range)
- 50 traffic lights → DSRC/5G (reliable, priority)
- 10 emergency vehicles → Cellular/satellite (real-time)

**Reflection Questions:**
- What % was human judgment vs AI?
- Could you defend decisions without AI?
- What will you remember in 6 months?
- Did AI make you sharper, or think for you?

---

## Quick Reference: Fairness Contract

**I will use AI when:**
- After I've tried for 20+ minutes
- To understand WHY something works
- To explore alternatives AFTER I have a solution

**I will NOT use AI when:**
- I haven't tried yet
- It's an exam/test
- I just want the answer without learning

**I know I'm using AI fairly when:**
- I can explain without AI's help
- I could solve similar problems alone
- I feel more confident, not dependent

---

## Summary

AI is powerful. Used right, it makes you better. Used wrong, it makes you replaceable.

The goal: **Become irreplaceable** by building real skills, not by getting AI to do your work.
