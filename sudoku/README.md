**NB: First Draft might not be quite understandable until I get to finish it!!!!!**

Excellent — this is the *teacher mindset*! 🧠💪
assuming you have never built a recursive or logic-based program before.

We’ll do it *step-by-step*

---

# 🎯 GOAL

We want to build a **Sudoku Solver** in Go that can:

1. Read **9 rows** from the command line (each has 9 characters).
2. Each cell can be:

   * A **number** (1–9)
   * Or a **dot (.)** meaning *empty cell*
3. Fill in all the dots correctly to make a **complete Sudoku grid** following Sudoku rules.
4. If the puzzle is invalid or has more than one solution, print **Error**.

---

# 🧩 STEP 1 — What is Sudoku?

Sudoku is a **9×9 grid** divided into 9 smaller boxes (3×3 each).

🧱 The rule is simple:

> Every row, column, and 3×3 box must have all numbers from **1 to 9** — no repeats.

Visual grid layout 👇

```
+-------+-------+-------+
| 5 . . | . . 7 | . . 4 |
| . 8 . | 1 . . | . . . |
| . . . | . 6 . | . 3 . |
+-------+-------+-------+
| . . 5 | 7 . . | 2 . . |
| 2 . . | . 5 . | . . 8 |
| . . 6 | . . 2 | 1 . . |
+-------+-------+-------+
| . 1 . | . 9 . | . . . |
| . . . | . . 4 | . 7 . |
| 4 . . | 6 . . | . . 9 |
+-------+-------+-------+
```

We must fill the `.` dots.

---

# ⚙️ STEP 2 — Program input format

When we run the program:

```bash
go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6...4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7"
```

Each quoted string `"..."` is **one row** of Sudoku.

That means we get **9 arguments** (rows).

So our Go program must:
✅ Read exactly 9 rows from `os.Args`.
✅ Each row must have exactly 9 characters.
✅ Only digits `1-9` or dot `.` allowed.

---

# 🧮 STEP 3 — Representing Sudoku in Go

We can think of the Sudoku grid like a **table** in memory:

| Concept                | Go Type     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| A cell (number or dot) | `int`       |
| A row                  | `[9]int`    |
| The full Sudoku        | `[9][9]int` |

So we’ll use:

```go
var grid [9][9]int
```

---

# 📦 STEP 4 — Why convert dots `.` to 0?

In Go, we can’t leave an array cell “empty”.
We’ll use `0` to mean “this cell has no number yet”.

Example:
Input row `"5.81.39.."`
→ becomes `[5, 0, 8, 1, 0, 3, 9, 0, 0]`

So:

```go
if ch == '.' {
    grid[row][col] = 0
} else {
    grid[row][col] = int(ch - '0')
}
```

---

# 🚧 STEP 5 — Checking if a Sudoku is valid

Before solving, we must ensure:
✅ No row repeats
✅ No column repeats
✅ No 3×3 box repeats

We’ll use 3 helper tables to track used numbers:

| Table            | Size                 | Meaning                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `rowUsed[9][10]` | 9 rows, numbers 1–9  | Is number used in this row?     |
| `colUsed[9][10]` | 9 cols, numbers 1–9  | Is number used in this column?  |
| `boxUsed[9][10]` | 9 boxes, numbers 1–9 | Is number used in this 3×3 box? |

Visual for `boxUsed`:

```
Boxes numbered like:
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
```

To find which box a cell belongs to:

```go
box := (row/3)*3 + (col/3)
```

Example:

* Cell (4,5) → box (4/3)*3 + (5/3) = 1*3 + 1 = box 4 (middle)

---

# 🧠 STEP 6 — Solving method (Backtracking)

This is the “brain” of the program.
It’s like a **smart guesser** that tries possibilities.

Let’s imagine this visually 👇

---

### 🪜 Backtracking visualization (cartoon version)

Suppose we have one empty cell:

```
|5|.|7|
```

We try:

* Try putting **1** → invalid
* Try putting **2** → valid, move on
* Try putting **3** → invalid
* etc.

If we hit a dead end (no valid numbers), we **go back** (backtrack) and change a previous guess.

So, it’s like exploring paths in a maze:

```
Try 1 → dead end
Go back
Try 2 → works → move ahead
Try 3 → dead end
Backtrack again
```

This is recursion in action!
A function calling itself until a full valid grid is formed.

---

# 🔄 STEP 7 — The recursive logic

Let’s explain the main idea with a tiny grid example (3×3 instead of 9×9):

```
[ [1, ., 3],
  [., 2, .],
  [., ., .] ]
```

We make a list of all empty positions:

```
EmptyCells = [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
```

Then we have a function `solve(pos int)`:

* If `pos == len(EmptyCells)` → we filled all → 🎉 solved!
* Else:

  * Look at `EmptyCells[pos]`
  * Try all numbers 1–9
  * If it fits rules → place it → call `solve(pos+1)`
  * If not → skip
  * If later it fails → remove number and try next

Visual loop for first cell:

```
Try (0,1)=1 ❌ invalid
Try (0,1)=2 ✅ valid → move to next
Try (0,1)=3 ❌ invalid
```

---

# 🧩 STEP 8 — Why we need uniqueness checking

We must confirm that the Sudoku has **only one solution**.
Some puzzles can be solved in many ways, but task says “one possible solution only”.

So we use a counter:

```go
solutions := 0
```

Every time we fill all cells successfully, we increase it:

```go
if pos == len(emptyCells) {
    solutions++
}
```

If `solutions > 1`, we can stop early → multiple solutions → **Error**.

---

# 🪄 STEP 9 — Why we use boolean arrays for speed

Without them, each time we want to check if a number is allowed,
we would have to scan 9 cells for:

* Row check
* Column check
* Box check

That’s 27 checks per cell! 😵‍💫

Using boolean trackers (`rowUsed`, `colUsed`, `boxUsed`) means:

* Checking is instant (`O(1)` time)
* No repeated scanning

Visualization:

```
Before placing 5 in row 2:
rowUsed[2][5] = true  ✅ fast lookup
colUsed[7][5] = true
boxUsed[3][5] = true
```

If we remove it (backtrack), we set them back to `false`.

---

# 🧾 STEP 10 — Output format

When solved, print the 9×9 numbers with spaces between them:

✅ Correct:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

❌ Wrong:

```
123456789
```

After solving, print nothing else (no blank lines).

If any error → just:

```
Error
```

---

# 🪶 STEP 11 — Program Flow (visualized)

```
START
 ↓
Check argument count = 9?   ❌ Error
 ↓
Check each row length = 9?  ❌ Error
 ↓
Convert to grid (dots → 0)
 ↓
Validate grid (no duplicates)
 ↓
Create helper trackers (rowUsed, colUsed, boxUsed)
 ↓
Run backtracking solver
    ↓
    Fill cell → recurse → backtrack
 ↓
If 1 solution found → print it
Else → Error
 ↓
END
```

# 🧩 STEP 13 — How to teach this visually in your group

1. Draw a **3×3 Sudoku** on the board with dots.
2. Act as the “solver”:

   * Try 1 → not possible
   * Try 2 → possible → move forward
   * If no number fits → erase last and go back.
3. Show how computers do the same automatically.
4. Use arrows or flow diagrams for recursion.
5. Then show the Go code and link each line to that story.

Great — this is the fun part. 

# 1) Quick summary of the task (one-liner)

Write a program that takes **nine command-line strings** (each length 9, characters `1`–`9` or `.` for empty), validates them, solves the Sudoku by backtracking, ensures the solution is **unique**, prints the 9×9 solved grid (numbers separated by single spaces, one row per line) — or prints `Error` for any invalid input or if the puzzle is unsolvable or has more than one solution.

# 2) Full, ready-to-run `main.go`

Save this file as `main.go` in your project root. It handles parsing, validation, solving, uniqueness checking, printing, and error output exactly as required.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

// Exit with "Error" (matching expected outputs)
func printErrorAndExit() {
	fmt.Println("Error")
	os.Exit(0)
}

func main() {
	// Expect exactly 9 arguments (the 9 rows)
	if len(os.Args) != 10 {
		printErrorAndExit()
	}
	rows := os.Args[1:]

	// Parse input into a 9x9 integer grid (0 for empty)
	grid := [9][9]int{}
	for r := 0; r < 9; r++ {
		if len(rows[r]) != 9 {
			printErrorAndExit()
		}
		for c, ch := range rows[r] {
			if ch == '.' {
				grid[r][c] = 0
			} else if ch >= '1' && ch <= '9' {
				grid[r][c] = int(ch - '0')
			} else {
				printErrorAndExit()
			}
		}
	}

	// Validate initial grid (no duplicates in row/col/box)
	if !isValidGrid(grid) {
		printErrorAndExit()
	}

	// Prepare trackers for fast validity checks while solving
	var rowUsed [9][10]bool
	var colUsed [9][10]bool
	var boxUsed [9][10]bool
	emptyCells := make([][2]int, 0, 81)
	for r := 0; r < 9; r++ {
		for c := 0; c < 9; c++ {
			val := grid[r][c]
			if val == 0 {
				emptyCells = append(emptyCells, [2]int{r, c})
			} else {
				rowUsed[r][val] = true
				colUsed[c][val] = true
				boxUsed[boxIndex(r, c)][val] = true
			}
		}
	}

	// We must ensure uniqueness: do a backtracking search and count solutions up to 2.
	var solutions int
	var solutionGrid [9][9]int
	solutions = 0

	// Backtracking solver with early exit when >1 solutions found.
	var backtrack func(pos int)
	backtrack = func(pos int) {
		if solutions > 1 {
			return // we already know there's more than one solution
		}
		if pos == len(emptyCells) {
			// found a complete solution: copy it and increment counter
			solutions++
			if solutions == 1 {
				solutionGrid = grid
			}
			return
		}

		// Simple heuristic: try candidates in order 1..9
		r := emptyCells[pos][0]
		c := emptyCells[pos][1]
		b := boxIndex(r, c)
		for val := 1; val <= 9; val++ {
			if rowUsed[r][val] || colUsed[c][val] || boxUsed[b][val] {
				continue
			}
			// place
			grid[r][c] = val
			rowUsed[r][val] = true
			colUsed[c][val] = true
			boxUsed[b][val] = true

			backtrack(pos + 1)

			// undo
			grid[r][c] = 0
			rowUsed[r][val] = false
			colUsed[c][val] = false
			boxUsed[b][val] = false

			if solutions > 1 {

		}
	}

	backtrack(0)

	// If exactly one solution, print it; otherwise Error
	if solutions != 1 {
		printErrorAndExit()
	}

	printGrid(solutionGrid)
}

// Helper: box index 0..8
func boxIndex(r, c int) int {
	return (r/3)*3 + (c / 3)
}

// Validate the initial grid: no repeated numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 box.
func isValidGrid(grid [9][9]int) bool {
	var rowUsed [9][10]bool
	var colUsed [9][10]bool
	var boxUsed [9][10]bool
	for r := 0; r < 9; r++ {
		for c := 0; c < 9; c++ {

				return false
			}
			rowUsed[r][v] = true
			colUsed[c][v] = true
			boxUsed[boxIndex(r, c)][v] = true
		}
	}
	return true
}

// Print grid in the required format: numbers separated by spaces, each row on its own line.
func printGrid(grid [9][9]int) {
	for r := 0; r < 9; r++ {
		for c := 0; c < 9; c++ {
			if c > 0 {
				fmt.Print(" ")
			}
			fmt.Print(grid[r][c])
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}
}
```

# 3) Plain-language explanation of the code and algorithm (very simple)

1. **Input check**: the program expects exactly 9 command-line arguments. If not, it prints `Error` and exits.
2. **Parsing**: each of the 9 strings must be length 9 and contain only characters `1`–`9` or `.`. `.` becomes `0` in our internal grid (represents empty).
3. **Initial validation**: before trying to solve, the program checks that the given digits do not already violate Sudoku rules (no repeated digit in any row, column, or 3×3 box). If invalid → `Error`.
4. **Solving**: uses **backtracking**:

   * Find every empty cell and keep a simple list `emptyCells`.
   * Keep three boolean tables to speed up checks:

     * `rowUsed[row][digit]`
     * `colUsed[col][digit]`
     * `boxUsed[boxIndex][digit]`
   * Recursively try filling each empty cell with candidates 1..9 that are not used in its row, column, or box.
   * When a full solution is found, increase a `solutions` counter.
   * Stop searching when `solutions > 1` (we only need to know if there’s more than one).
5. **Uniqueness requirement**: if solutions ≠ 1 (that is 0 or >1), print `Error`. Only when exactly one solution is found we print it.
6. **Printing**: the solution is printed exactly as expected: nine rows; numbers separated by single spaces.

# 4) Why backtracking and why the boolean trackers?

* Backtracking is the natural approach to fill empty cells: try a number, recurse, undo if it fails.
* The boolean arrays (`rowUsed`, `colUsed`, `boxUsed`) let us check whether a number is valid in O(1) time instead of scanning a row/column/box (O(9) each). That’s a huge speed boost for typical puzzles.
* Using `emptyCells` list lets the recursion focus only on empty positions, not scanning full board each step.

# 5) Ensuring uniqueness (important)

* We must detect if there’s **more than one** solution. To do that we:

  * Allow the solver to continue after finding the first solution, but stop when `solutions > 1`.
  * We save the first found solution so we can print it only if exactly one solution exists (but the solver still needs to know about other possible solutions).
* If you stop at first solution and print it without checking for others, you might print a valid board even though the puzzle has multiple solutions — the task forbids that.

# 6) Complexity (simple words)

* Sudoku backtracking worst-case is large (exponential), but real Sudoku with typical constraints solves quickly with simple heuristics and the boolean trackers.
* Using `rowUsed/colUsed/boxUsed` is a constant-factor improvement that makes backtracking practical in contest/task environments.

# 7) Edge cases and how the program handles them (students must prepare for these)

* **Wrong number of arguments** → `Error`.
* **Argument length ≠ 9** → `Error`.
* **Invalid characters** (anything other than `.` or `1`–`9`) → `Error`.
* **Initial contradictions** (same digit twice in same row/col/box) → `Error`.
* **No solution** → `Error`.
* **More than one solution** → `Error`.
* **Leading/trailing spaces**: not allowed — command-line arguments are taken raw; user must pass strings exactly.
* **All empty grid `.........` × 9**: that has many solutions → `Error` (not unique).

# 8) Common student questions & concise answers (prep)

Q: *Why store 0 for empty?*
A: It's convenient. 0 is not a valid Sudoku number, so it’s easy to detect empties.

Q: *Why boolean arrays up to index 10?*
A: We index digits by their numeric value 1..9; slot 0 is unused. So `rowUsed[row][val]` is straightforward.

Q: *Why check uniqueness?*
A: The task states a valid Sudoku must have exactly one solution. Many puzzles have multiple solutions; printing any one would violate the spec.

Q: *Can I use heuristics like "most constrained cell first"?*
A: Yes — it speeds up solving. The simple version above tries cells in the order they appear, which is usually fine for task inputs.

Q: *What if a puzzle is solvable only with advanced constraints (X-Wing, Swordfish)?*
A: A brute-force backtracking solver will still find a solution because it explores all possibilities systematically; you don’t need specialized human techniques.

Q: *Should I print extra spaces or blank lines?*
A: No — match the expected format: exactly 9 lines, each containing `9` numbers separated by single spaces. Otherwise judge scripts/matchers will fail.

# 9) Testing checklist (what students should try)

* Test with valid puzzles that have a unique solution (should print solved grid).
* Test with invalid initial boards (duplicate numbers in row/col/box) → `Error`.
* Test with less/more arguments → `Error`.
* Test with invalid characters (`A`, `0`, `:`) → `Error`.
* Test with puzzles that have 0 solutions → `Error`.
* Test with puzzles that have multiple solutions (e.g., all dots) → `Error`.
* Use `| cat -e` in examples to ensure you don’t have stray spaces/newlines.

# 10) Debug tips (simple)

* If you get `panic` or index-out-of-range, print intermediate values; confirm every row string has length 9.
* To debug solver behavior, temporarily print the partial grid at certain recursive depths (but remove prints before submission).
* If solver is very slow on some inputs, try choosing the empty cell with the fewest candidate numbers (MRV heuristic — Minimum Remaining Values).

# 11) Alternate improvements (if you want to be fancy)

* MRV heuristic: pick the empty cell with the fewest legal options next — greatly reduces branching.
* Forward-checking: maintain candidates for each cell and update them as you place numbers.
* Use bitmasks (`uint16`) instead of booleans to speed up and compress state.
* Implement dancing links (DLX) for the fastest exact-cover solution (overkill for this task).

# 12) Submission & file checklist (what to include)

* `main.go` (the file above) — single-file program is simplest.
* No additional files necessary.
* Make sure `go.mod` is not required by the judge (if it is, create a minimal `module` file or submit a single-file program without external imports).
* Ensure your program prints `Error` exactly when required, and exactly the solved grid otherwise.

# 13) Final words — how to think about solving this task

* Break the problem into *small parts*: parse → validate → solve → check uniqueness → print.
* Always validate early: invalid inputs should be rejected before attempting heavy computation.
* Keep the solver correct first, then optimize to make it fast enough for typical tests.
* Make sure output format is exact. Judges are strict about formatting.

### 🧠 How It Works (Recap)

* **`sudoku.go`**: Handles input, validation, and prints results.
* **`piscine/sudoku.go`**: Contains the **logic** — recursion, validation, and printing.

### 🧩 How to Run the Program

#### 1️⃣ In your terminal:

```bash
cd sudoku
```

#### 2️⃣ Run with a valid Sudoku input:

```bash
go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6...4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7"
```

#### 3️⃣ ✅ Expected Output:

```
3 9 6 2 4 5 7 8 1
1 7 8 3 6 9 5 2 4
5 2 4 8 1 7 3 9 6
2 8 7 9 5 1 6 4 3
9 3 1 4 8 6 2 7 5
4 6 5 7 2 3 9 1 8
7 1 2 6 3 8 4 5 9
6 5 9 1 7 4 8 3 2
8 4 3 5 9 2 1 6 7
```

### ⚠️ Error Cases

Try these to understand error handling:

```bash
go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6.1.4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7"
```

👉 Output:

```
Error
```

Or if you pass less/more arguments:

```bash
go run . 1 2 3 4
```

👉 Output:

```
Error
```

## 🧩 1️⃣ How to Run the Sudoku Solver Program on your own

You’ll be working in a Go environment (like VS Code, terminal, or online Go playground that supports packages).

Make sure your file structure looks like this:

```
sudoku/ # This is the folder already cloned from the group leader's repo
 ├── main.go
 └── piscine/
     └── sudoku.go
```

Inside `main.go`, you have your `package main` and it calls the Sudoku solver (that’s where your full code from the first response goes).

---

## 🧠 2️⃣ How to Execute It

In your terminal, move into the project folder:

```bash
cd sudoku
```

Then run the program with **9 arguments** — each representing one Sudoku row.
Example (the dots `.` are empty spaces):

```bash
go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6...4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7"
```

---

## 🧾 3️⃣ Expected Output (for a valid Sudoku)

If the Sudoku is **valid** and solvable, you should see this (each number separated by spaces):

```
3 9 6 2 4 5 7 8 1
1 7 8 3 6 9 5 2 4
5 2 4 8 1 7 3 9 6
2 8 7 9 5 1 6 4 3
9 3 1 4 8 6 2 7 5
4 6 5 7 2 3 9 1 8
7 1 2 6 3 8 4 5 9
6 5 9 1 7 4 8 3 2
8 4 3 5 9 2 1 6 7
```

✅ This means your Sudoku was solved successfully.

---

## 🚫 4️⃣ Expected Output for Invalid Input

If you make a mistake (for example, not 9 rows, invalid characters, or conflicting numbers), you should get:

```
Error
```

Example tests:

```bash
go run . 1 2 3 4
```

Output:

```
Error
```

or

```bash
go run .
```

Output:

```
Error
```

or if two of the same numbers exist in the same row/column:

```bash
go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6.1.4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7"
```

Output:

```
Error
```

## 🧩 5️⃣ Quick Practical Visualization (for Memory Retention)

Think of Sudoku like a **9×9 classroom grid** where:

* Each row = a row of chairs 🪑🪑🪑
* Each column = a vertical line of students
* Each 3×3 block = a smaller group of 9 students

Your task (the algorithm) is like a teacher walking through the classroom:

1. 👀 Check who’s sitting (the numbers already filled in).
2. ✏️ Find an empty chair (`.`).
3. 🧠 Try numbers 1–9 in that chair:

   * If no one else in the row, column, or small group already has that number — it’s okay to sit there.
4. If the teacher reaches a mistake (someone else has the same number):

   * 🧹 Erase it (backtrack).
   * Try the next possible number.

When all chairs are filled — Sudoku solved 🎉.

## 🧩 6️⃣ Common Beginner Questions

| Question                               | Simple Explanation                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Why do we use recursion?**           | Because Sudoku is a step-by-step trial process — recursion “remembers” the previous steps and backtracks automatically when something doesn’t fit. |
| **Why check 3×3 subgrids separately?** | Sudoku rules say each smaller 3×3 box must also have unique numbers (1–9).                                                                         |
| **Why dots `.` for blanks?**           | Dots make it easier to read and pass as strings; they mean “empty cell.”                                                                           |
| **Why print with spaces?**             | To make the grid clean and human-readable.                                                                                                         |
| **Why print `Error` sometimes?**       | To warn that either your input was invalid or the Sudoku can’t be solved.                                                                          |
