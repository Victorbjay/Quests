**NB: First Draft might not be quite understandable until I get to finish it!!!!!**

Excellent — this is the *teacher mindset*! 🧠💪
assuming you have never built a recursive or logic-based program before.

We’ll do it *step-by-step*

---

# 🎯 GOAL

We want to build a **Sudoku Solver** in Go that can:

1. Read **9 rows** from the command line (each has 9 characters).
2. Each cell can be:

   * A **number** (1–9)
   * Or a **dot (.)** meaning *empty cell*
3. Fill in all the dots correctly to make a **complete Sudoku grid** following Sudoku rules.
4. If the puzzle is invalid or has more than one solution, print **Error**.

---

# 🧩 STEP 1 — What is Sudoku?

Sudoku is a **9×9 grid** divided into 9 smaller boxes (3×3 each).

🧱 The rule is simple:

> Every row, column, and 3×3 box must have all numbers from **1 to 9** — no repeats.

Visual grid layout 👇

```
+-------+-------+-------+
| 5 . . | . . 7 | . . 4 |
| . 8 . | 1 . . | . . . |
| . . . | . 6 . | . 3 . |
+-------+-------+-------+
| . . 5 | 7 . . | 2 . . |
| 2 . . | . 5 . | . . 8 |
| . . 6 | . . 2 | 1 . . |
+-------+-------+-------+
| . 1 . | . 9 . | . . . |
| . . . | . . 4 | . 7 . |
| 4 . . | 6 . . | . . 9 |
+-------+-------+-------+
```

We must fill the `.` dots.

---

# ⚙️ STEP 2 — Program input format

When we run the program:

```bash
go run . ".96.4...1" "1...6...4" "5.481.39." "..795..43" ".3..8...." "4.5.23.18" ".1.63..59" ".59.7.83." "..359...7"
```

Each quoted string `"..."` is **one row** of Sudoku.

That means we get **9 arguments** (rows).

So our Go program must:
✅ Read exactly 9 rows from `os.Args`.
✅ Each row must have exactly 9 characters.
✅ Only digits `1-9` or dot `.` allowed.

---

# 🧮 STEP 3 — Representing Sudoku in Go

We can think of the Sudoku grid like a **table** in memory:

| Concept                | Go Type     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| A cell (number or dot) | `int`       |
| A row                  | `[9]int`    |
| The full Sudoku        | `[9][9]int` |

So we’ll use:

```go
var grid [9][9]int
```

---

# 📦 STEP 4 — Why convert dots `.` to 0?

In Go, we can’t leave an array cell “empty”.
We’ll use `0` to mean “this cell has no number yet”.

Example:
Input row `"5.81.39.."`
→ becomes `[5, 0, 8, 1, 0, 3, 9, 0, 0]`

So:

```go
if ch == '.' {
    grid[row][col] = 0
} else {
    grid[row][col] = int(ch - '0')
}
```

---

# 🚧 STEP 5 — Checking if a Sudoku is valid

Before solving, we must ensure:
✅ No row repeats
✅ No column repeats
✅ No 3×3 box repeats

We’ll use 3 helper tables to track used numbers:

| Table            | Size                 | Meaning                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `rowUsed[9][10]` | 9 rows, numbers 1–9  | Is number used in this row?     |
| `colUsed[9][10]` | 9 cols, numbers 1–9  | Is number used in this column?  |
| `boxUsed[9][10]` | 9 boxes, numbers 1–9 | Is number used in this 3×3 box? |

Visual for `boxUsed`:

```
Boxes numbered like:
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
```

To find which box a cell belongs to:

```go
box := (row/3)*3 + (col/3)
```

Example:

* Cell (4,5) → box (4/3)*3 + (5/3) = 1*3 + 1 = box 4 (middle)

---

# 🧠 STEP 6 — Solving method (Backtracking)

This is the “brain” of the program.
It’s like a **smart guesser** that tries possibilities.

Let’s imagine this visually 👇

---

### 🪜 Backtracking visualization (cartoon version)

Suppose we have one empty cell:

```
|5|.|7|
```

We try:

* Try putting **1** → invalid
* Try putting **2** → valid, move on
* Try putting **3** → invalid
* etc.

If we hit a dead end (no valid numbers), we **go back** (backtrack) and change a previous guess.

So, it’s like exploring paths in a maze:

```
Try 1 → dead end
Go back
Try 2 → works → move ahead
Try 3 → dead end
Backtrack again
```

This is recursion in action!
A function calling itself until a full valid grid is formed.

---

# 🔄 STEP 7 — The recursive logic

Let’s explain the main idea with a tiny grid example (3×3 instead of 9×9):

```
[ [1, ., 3],
  [., 2, .],
  [., ., .] ]
```

We make a list of all empty positions:

```
EmptyCells = [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
```

Then we have a function `solve(pos int)`:

* If `pos == len(EmptyCells)` → we filled all → 🎉 solved!
* Else:

  * Look at `EmptyCells[pos]`
  * Try all numbers 1–9
  * If it fits rules → place it → call `solve(pos+1)`
  * If not → skip
  * If later it fails → remove number and try next

Visual loop for first cell:

```
Try (0,1)=1 ❌ invalid
Try (0,1)=2 ✅ valid → move to next
Try (0,1)=3 ❌ invalid
```

---

# 🧩 STEP 8 — Why we need uniqueness checking

We must confirm that the Sudoku has **only one solution**.
Some puzzles can be solved in many ways, but task says “one possible solution only”.

So we use a counter:

```go
solutions := 0
```

Every time we fill all cells successfully, we increase it:

```go
if pos == len(emptyCells) {
    solutions++
}
```

If `solutions > 1`, we can stop early → multiple solutions → **Error**.

---

# 🪄 STEP 9 — Why we use boolean arrays for speed

Without them, each time we want to check if a number is allowed,
we would have to scan 9 cells for:

* Row check
* Column check
* Box check

That’s 27 checks per cell! 😵‍💫

Using boolean trackers (`rowUsed`, `colUsed`, `boxUsed`) means:

* Checking is instant (`O(1)` time)
* No repeated scanning

Visualization:

```
Before placing 5 in row 2:
rowUsed[2][5] = true  ✅ fast lookup
colUsed[7][5] = true
boxUsed[3][5] = true
```

If we remove it (backtrack), we set them back to `false`.

---

# 🧾 STEP 10 — Output format

When solved, print the 9×9 numbers with spaces between them:

✅ Correct:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

❌ Wrong:

```
123456789
```

After solving, print nothing else (no blank lines).

If any error → just:

```
Error
```

---

# 🪶 STEP 11 — Program Flow (visualized)

```
START
 ↓
Check argument count = 9?   ❌ Error
 ↓
Check each row length = 9?  ❌ Error
 ↓
Convert to grid (dots → 0)
 ↓
Validate grid (no duplicates)
 ↓
Create helper trackers (rowUsed, colUsed, boxUsed)
 ↓
Run backtracking solver
    ↓
    Fill cell → recurse → backtrack
 ↓
If 1 solution found → print it
Else → Error
 ↓
END
```

# 🧩 STEP 13 — How to teach this visually in your group

1. Draw a **3×3 Sudoku** on the board with dots.
2. Act as the “solver”:

   * Try 1 → not possible
   * Try 2 → possible → move forward
   * If no number fits → erase last and go back.
3. Show how computers do the same automatically.
4. Use arrows or flow diagrams for recursion.
5. Then show the Go code and link each line to that story.
